Garibenka allows users to learn Japanese kanji and vocabulary through an interactive format of a chat with a bot. 
The bot generates answers based on user-provided tables, and grades user's performance afterwards, 
allowing them to review the material if needed.

The app comes with two color theme options and two language options (English and Russian). 
It also includes two ready to use vocabulary sets.

GUI made with wxWidgets. UI icons by SYD.
